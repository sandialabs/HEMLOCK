HEMLOCK is a software tool for constructing, evaluating, and applying heterogeneous ensemble data models for use in solving supervised machine learning problems. Specifically, the main class of problems targeted by HEMLOCK is the problem of multiple-class classification (also called labeling or categorization) of data with continuous or discrete features. HEMLOCK consists of various data readers, machine learning algorithms, model combination and comparison routines, evaluation methods for model performance testing, and interfaces to external, state-of-the-art machine learning software libraries.

<p>
HEMLOCK creates models of correlations and patterns found in empirical data sets. These models are then used for data classification and labeling, trend analysis and prediction, data clustering, and information organization of data not used in building the models.

<p>
HEMLOCK uses an XML for all input and output, and standard Java readers and writers are being used for data input and output. Data models are created by a variety of supervised learning methods: decision tree and random forest inducers plus a linear perceptron learner as part of HEMLOCK along with interfaces to the methods available in the WEKA (external) software library of machine learning algorithms. Evaluation methods for assessing individual model performance include accuracy computation, confusion matrix generation, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, and area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Methods for combining heterogeneous models into a single ensemble model include majority voting and parameter regression.
